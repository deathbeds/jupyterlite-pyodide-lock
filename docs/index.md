## Why Use This?

- in the browser
  - fetches `pyodide-kernel`, its dependencies, and configured packages in parallel
    while `pyodide` is starting, skipping `micropip.install` and its requests to
    the PyPI API
  - doesn't require `%pip install` for locked packages and their dependencies
    - notebooks and scripts still need to be well-formed, e.g. `import my_package`
    - once shipped, package versions loaded in the browser won't change over time
- during a build
  - doesn't require rebuilding a full custom `pyodide` distribution
    - but will patch an custom deployed `pyodide`
    - all downloaded wheels can be optionally shipped along with the application
  - optionally clamp PyPI packages to a known timestamp to ensure newer packages
    aren't found during a future solve
  - supports multiple sources of custom wheels and dependencies

### Feature Comparison

A number of approaches are available for getting reproducible JupyterLite runtime
python environments, either with `jupyterlite-pyodide-kernel` or other kernels.
Choosing one requires some trades of simplicity, reproducibility, flexibility,
and performance.
